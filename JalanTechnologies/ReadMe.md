# README

This repository contains a Java code package for a simple car service billing system. The program allows users to select a car type and services, and generates a bill based on the selections. The code is organized into different packages and classes to achieve modularity and extensibility.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the code files.
3. Open the code in your preferred Java development environment.
4. Compile and run the `Driver` class.

## Code Structure

The code package has the following structure:

- **com.jalanTechnologies.oop** package:
  - **Driver** class: Main entry point for the program. It prompts the user to select a car type and services, and generates the bill accordingly.
  - **Bill** class: Generates the bill based on the selected car type and services.
- **com.jalanTechnologies.oop.services** package:
  - **Service** interface: Defines the contract for a service. Includes methods to get the service code and charges for different car types.
  - Concrete service classes such as **BasicService**, **BrakeFixing**, **ClutchFixing**, **EngineFixing**, and **GearFixing** implement the **Service** interface.
- **com.jalanTechnologies.oop.vehicals** package:
  - **Vehical** interface: Defines the contract for a vehicle. Includes a method to get the name of the vehicle.
  - Concrete vehicle classes such as **HatchBack**, **Sedan**, and **SUV** implement the **Vehical** interface.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to select a car type (Hatchback, Sedan, or SUV) and choose services from the provided options. The program will calculate the total bill based on your selections and display the bill details.
